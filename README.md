First of all, **download** the project and **unzip** it.
Then, open **Command Prompt** and go to the **project folder** 
(hint: `cd D:\folder\another_folder\Project_folder`). 
**Inside the folder**, type the followings one by one:
1. `pip install django`
2. `pip install virtualenv`
3. `pip install beautifulsoup4`
4. `pip install google`
5. `pip install nltk`
6. `python -m nltk.downloader all`

After you have installed all dependencies, type
`python manage.py runserver` or `py manage.py runserver`
(for python v3)

The server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or 
`http://localhost:8000/` if every thing works correctly


## Attention!
**The project is done using python v3+. If you have installed python v2 or lower, you cannot run the project. In order to run it, you need to uninstall the old version first and install the newer one (v3+). But if you have installed both versions, then you have to differentiate between command words like `python` and `pip`. You can refer to following links:**
